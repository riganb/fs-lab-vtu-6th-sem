# FS LAB Code for VTU 2018 Scheme 6th Sem

### This is a project I have started to write code files for FS Lab as efficiently (more of as short) as possible.

<br>

As of now, I have added these files:
- Program 2: Storing fixed length records
- Program 5: Primary-Key (USN) Based Indexing
- Program 6: Secondary-Key (Name) Based Indexing
- Program 7: Merging common records from 2 files
